Breathe is a simple meditation timer I created. I wanted to make a simple timer for my own use that was inspiring and aesthetically pleasing. I hope Iâ€™ve achieved that and some of you find value in it as well.

Breathe is coded with Javascript and a little jQuery.  

I've made use of a some other people's code:
* [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)
* [Computer-sleep](https://github.com/ivanmaeder/computer-sleep/)
* [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/)

Thanks for stopping by. I'm on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/adamelnaggar_) if you have any feedback.
